    <h2 class="header">About rugby</h2>
        <p>Rugby union or more often just rugby, is a close-contact team sport that originated at Rugby School in England in the first half of the 19th century. Rugby is simply based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players each, using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.</p>

    <h2> About the All Blacks Team</h2>
        <p>Founded in 1892, New Zealand Rugby has teams based in Wellington and Auckland as well as a number of people working out in the rugby community and with high performance teams. New Zealand Rugby has direct relationships with its members, including all 26 Provincial Unions, Sky Super Rugby teams, sponsors, and stakeholders such as the New Zealand Government.</p>

    <h2>The all blacks past achievements</h2>
        <p>The team won the Rugby World Cup in 1987, 2011 and 2015. They were the first country to win the Rugby World Cup 3 times and the first country to retain the Rugby World Cup. New Zealand has a 76 percent winning record in test-match rugby, and has secured more wins than losses against every test opponent. Since their international debut in 1903, New Zealand teams have played test matches against 19 nations, of which 12 have never won a game against the All Blacks.</p>

            <h2> My team</h2>
                <p>Founded in 1892, New Zealand Rugby has teams based in Wellington and Auckland as well as a number of people working out in the rugby community and with high performance teams. New Zealand Rugby has direct relationships with its members, including all 26 Provincial Unions, Sky Super Rugby teams, sponsors, and stakeholders such as the New Zealand Government.</p>



            <h2>My teams past achievements</h2>
                <p>The team won the Rugby World Cup in 1987, 2011 and 2015. They were the first country to win the Rugby World Cup 3 times and the first country to retain the Rugby World Cup. New Zealand has a 76 percent winning record in test-match rugby, and has secured more wins than losses against every test opponent. Since their international debut in 1903, New Zealand teams have played test matches against 19 nations, of which 12 have never won a game against the All Blacks.</p>

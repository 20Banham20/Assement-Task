        <p> My teams past achievements is that they have won schoolboy footballs quadruple of top-level trophies, including the national secondary-school title.<br></p>
        
        <p> They sealed the achievement a historic first for the school with a 3-1 win against Selwyn College last Friday to take the Knockout Cup.<br></p>
        
        <p> They won the Auckland premier title and the Alex Harvey Industries Trophy late last month, before beating St Peters 1-0 in the prestigious premier national tournament final in Christchurch.<br></p>
        
        <p> Head coach Dave Wright said that in winning all four trophies the players had achieved a goal they set at the start of the season.<br></p>
         
        <p>Their national title Westlakes fourth was won in extra time, after the score was tied 0-0 at the end of regulation time. The game looked as though it was heading to penalties when Westlakes Damion Kim whipped in a corner, meeting the head of Finn McKenlay, who found the back of the net in the 19th minute of extra time.‚Äù<br></p>
